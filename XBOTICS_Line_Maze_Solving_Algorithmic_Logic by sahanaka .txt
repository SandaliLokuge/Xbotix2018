Logic

Basics
1.Robot finds left --> He goes left
2.Robot finds Right --> He goes Right
3.Robot finds T --> He goes Right

Sequential Basics
1.If the robot find the sequence 'left,forward,180Turn,forward,TJunction' --> He goes left
2.If the robot find the sequence 'Right,forward,180Turn,forward,TJunction' --> He goes Right

Sequential Equations
left,forward,180turn,forward,right=180Turn
left,forward,180turn,forward,right=180Turn
example - can be extended to left,forward,left,forward,180turn,forward,right,forward,TJunction



Sequential Complex models
1.Robot will miss all the junctions except TJunctions for a count where count = #180Turns that it takes after its first TJunction
 after a left or right and zero 180Variables
